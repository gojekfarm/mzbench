A complete MZBench installation consists of two parts:

 - MZBench API server that accepts client requests and provides the dashboard.
 - A set of hosts operating as a worker nodes.

Once launched, the API server is permanent, whereas the worker nodes are dynamically
allocated on demand on AWS or another cloud provider.

Here's how you install and configure MZBench for real-life use.


# Installation

## From RPM and Pip

Available for CentOS 7 and Amazon Linux.

Requirement:

 - [Pip]((https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)) Python package manager

Download MZBench RPM from [Github releases page](https://github.com/gojekfarm/mzbench/releases)

```bash
# Install RPM
sudo yum install -y <rpm_file_downloaded_from_github_releases>

# Install Python package
sudo pip install mzbench_api_client

# Start the server
mzbench start_server
```

MZBench server from RPM has all [Github workers](https://github.com/gojekfarm/mzbench/tree/master/workers) bundled.
If you need to add a worker to this installation, please use `mzbench add_worker <tgz_file>`
command. Please refer to ["How to write your own worker"](workers.md#how-to-write-a-worker)
guide to learn more about generation of this tarball.

## From Docker container

Docker is a container platform, more information is available at its [website](https://www.docker.com/). If you have Docker up and running, use the following command to start MZBench server:

```bash
docker run -d -p 4800:80 --name mzbench_server docker.io/ridrisov/mzbench
```

After that, open http://localhost:4800/ to see the dashboard. Sources for this docker image are available on [github](https://github.com/gojekfarm/mzbench/tree/master/docker).

## From sources

Requirements:

 - [Erlang R17+](http://www.erlang.org)
 - C++ compiler (preinstalled on most UNIX-based systems)
 - [Python](https://www.python.org) 2.6 or 2.7
 - [Pip]((https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)) Python package manager

Install and start the MZBench API server:

```bash
# Clone the current MZBench source code
git clone https://github.com/gojekfarm/mzbench.git

# Install Python requirements
sudo pip install -r mzbench/requirements.txt

# Start the server
./mzbench/bin/mzbench start_server
```


# Configuration

!!!note
    Every time you update the configuration, [restart the server](cli.md#restart_server).


## Format

The MZBench server parameters are defined in the configuration file.

By default, the server tries to load configuration from *~/.config/mzbench/server.config* and */etc/mzbench/server.config*.

To specify a configuration file from a different location, use the `--config` param:

```bash
$ ./bin/mzbench start_server --config /path/to/server.config
```

The configuration file is an Erlang list with the `mzbench_api` tuple. This tuple holds the list of the server [parameters](#parameters):

```erlang
[
    {mzbench_api, [
        {network_interface, "127.0.0.1"},
        {listen_port, 80}
    ]}
].
```

Here, two parameters are specified: [network_interface](#network_interface) and [listen_port](#listen_port).

All parameters are optional.


## Parameters

### cloud_plugins

```erlang
{cloud_plugins: [
    {<PluginName>, #{module => <ModuleName>,
                    <Option1> => <Value1>,
                    <Option2> => <Value2>,
                    ...
                    }
    },
    ...
    ]
}
```

List of [cloud plugins](cloud_plugins.md) that can be used to allocate nodes. One plugin can be listed multiple times with different settings and under different names.

**`<PluginName>`** is an atom identifying a plugin instance.

**`<ModuleName>`** is the name of the plugin module. Each module has its specific **`<Options>`**.

There are four built-in plugins:

[mzb_api_ec2_plugin](cloud_plugins.md#amazon-ec2)
:   Allocate hosts from the Amazon EC2 cloud.

[mzb_staticcloud_plugin](cloud_plugins.md#static-cloud)
:   Allocates hosts from a static pool.

[mzb_dummycloud_plugin](cloud_plugins.md#dummy)
:   Dummy provider, treats localhost as unlimited number of hosts, useful for debug. It can be also used as a reference during [cloud plugin development](cloud_plugins.md#how-to-write-a-cloud-plugin).

[mzb_multicloud_plugin](cloud_plugins.md#multicloud)
:   Allocate hosts from multiple sources with the given ratio.


### network_interface

```erlang
{network_interface, "<ip address>"}
```

Specify the IP address for the dashboard to run on. By default it's `"127.0.0.1"`, so the dashboard is unavailable for external connections.

To open the dashboard to the public, set this param to `"0.0.0.0"`.

!!!warning
    By default MZBench provides no authentication. Opening the dashboard to the public makes your server vulnerable.

    To protect your server, please, see [authentication](deployment.md#authentication) and [protocol](deployment.md#protocol).


### listen_port

```erlang
{listen_port, <port>}
```

Specify the port to access the dashboard.

Default value: `4800`.

### protocol

By default protocol is set to `http`, but `https` is also available. MZBench generates self-signed certificates on first start. If you need to replace them, please use the following configuration parameters:

```erlang
{protocol, https},
{cacertfile, none},
{certfile, "~/.local/share/mzbench_api/server.crt"},
{keyfile, "~/.local/share/mzbench_api/server.key"},
```

CA certificate is not required unless you use custom CA.

### authentication

API server supports Google and GitHub auth.

 - To create Google credentials open [Google API manager page](https://console.developers.google.com). Click Credentials -> Create credentials -> OAuth Client ID -> Web Application, then specify your server URL. Copy `client_id` and `client_secret` to a following structure.

```erlang
{user_authentication,
         [
          {"google", [{caption, "Google"},
                      {client_id, "..."},
                      {client_secret, "..."},
                      {redirect_url, "http://localhost:4800"}]}
         ]
     }
```

`http://localhost:4800` should be replaced with your server's address.

 - To create GitHub credentials open [GitHub developer application](https://github.com/settings/developers) page. Click Register New Application. Put your server url to "Homepage URL" and "Authorization callback URL" and click "Register application".

```erlang
{user_authentication,
         [
          {"github", [{caption, "GitHub"},
                      {client_id, "..."},
                      {client_secret, "..."}]}
         ]
     }
```

If GitHub Enterprise is used it may be usefull to add the following two parameters:

```erlang
    {url, "https://<GitHub URL>"},
    {api_url, "https://<GitHub API URL>"},
```

After successful setup you will be able to authorize yourself at dashboard and create tokens for Command Line Utilities (CLI). To create one hover your name at top-right corner of the dashboard and click "Generate token" link.
When token is generated it should be saved in ~/.config/mzbench/token file. If multiple mzbench servers are used token file could be organized the following way:

```
<Server1> <Token1>
<Server2> <Token2>
<Server3> <Token3>
...
```

#### access_lists

It is possible to specify white and black user lists in a following way:

```erlang
    {admin_list, ["*@mydomain-admins.com", "root@mydomain.com"]},
    {black_list, ["hacker*", "single-hacker@mydomain.com"]},
    {white_list, ["tester*@mydomain.com", "single-tester@mydomain.com"]},
```

Administrators have privileges to stop any benchmark. Blacklisted users have no access. If white list is used, all users, except this list have no access.

### bench_log_file

```

Default value: `"metrics.txt"`
